# Contributing
Contributing is easy, just [fork](https://github.com/pazuzu156/Barista#fork-destination-box) the repo!

## Branding submissions
If you add a new language, please brand it. We all want to know who made the submission! We're all programmers, so let people know what you contributed.

To brand your code, and code that you personally edit (not including any IDE generated files) add a comment block at the top of your code like so:

```cpp
/**
 * Barista <LANGUAGE> Example
 *
 * Coded in <EDITOR>: <EDITOR_URL>
 * License: NONE
 * Repo: https://github.com/pazuzu156/barista
 * Creator: <NAME> (<GITHUB_PAGE>)
 */
```

Replace `<LANGUAGE>` with the language you submitted. `<EDITOR>` with the name of the editor you used. `<EDITOR_URL>` with the URL of the editor you used, so users can find it. `<NAME>` with your name (or online handle if you prefer that). `<GITHUB_PAGE>` the URL for your GitHub profile, so users can find you on GitHub!

Since there is no license to this repo, leave license at `NONE`

## Junk Files
Please don't include junk files in submissions. If you are using an IDE that generates binaries, config scripts, etc. please add them to the `.gitignore` file.
