# Barista
Project made fron a [picture post](https://www.facebook.com/programmingjokes/posts/652247888278181:0) on Facebook from [Programming Jokes](https://www.facebook.com/programmingjokes/)

## Projects
I got bored, and decided to take the code from the original image (in JavaScript) and convert that over to a few other languages.

The languages are:  
1. JavaScript (Original)  
2. C++  
3. C#  
4. PHP  
5. Python
6. Java

Project files for Java (eclipse) are included as well as solution files for C#. For C++, a build script (makefile) is included, and a shell script for running PHP terminal server is also included for PHP.

## Special
C++ makefile is made for cross-compilation. However, the clean portion is not, since it executes shell scripts for deleting files. `clean` is for Unix (Mac, Linux, etc.) and clean-w is for Windows. Simple! :p

## License, Copying, All That Other Sh*t
There's NO license. Therefore, there are no restrictions. Do whatever you want with the code!
